          <p>Creating and nesting components 
React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:</p>
          <p>
          Writing markup with JSX 
The markup syntax youâ€™ve seen above is called JSX. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience. All of the tools we recommend for local development support JSX out of the box.
          </p>
        </center>
    </div>

export default Home
